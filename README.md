# Project: Blog Backend Service
# spring boot
## Overview
This project is a backend service built using Java Spring Boot that allows users to create, retrieve, and manage blogs. It includes database interactions using JPA, an AI-powered text summarization feature, and deployment on AWS. The goal is to provide a scalable and efficient blog management system.
  
## Features
### 1. Backend API (Spring Boot + JPA)
The application provides RESTful APIs to manage blogs, including adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting blog posts. It uses Spring Data JPA to handle database operations efficiently with PostgreSQL/MySQL.

### 2. AI-Powered Text Summarization
A dedicated endpoint is available to summarize blog content using the OpenAI API or a simple NLP library like spaCy. This helps users get quick insights from long-form content.

### 3. Deployment on AWS
The application is containerized using Docker and can be deployed on AWS EC2 or AWS Lambda with API Gateway. Optional features include storing blog images in AWS S3.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd blog-backend-service
   ```
2. **Configure the Database**
   - Update `application.properties` or `application.yml` with your PostgreSQL/MySQL credentials.
   
3. **Run the Application**
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Dockerization (Optional)**
   - Build Docker image:
     ```sh
     docker build -t blog-backend .
     ```
   - Run Docker container:
     ```sh
     docker run -p 8080:8080 blog-backend
     ```

## API Endpoints
